# Bathy_SDB
Python application for Bathymetric data management with PostGis.
This project aims to implement a practical and functional solution for storing and accessing 
high resolution bathymetric and topographic data in an efficient way, using free software (FOSS). 
For data storage and management the PostgreSql (version 9.3) relational database system was choosed,
complemented by PostGis extensions for spatial data, and the “pgpointcloud” library extension for 
dealing with point cloud data.
